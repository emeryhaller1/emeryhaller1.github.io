    <h1>Projects worth Recognition</h1>

    <h3>MIS Homework Website</h3>
    <p>This assignment not only helped me to better understand how to create a webiste, but also allowed me to practice applying the concepts I learned.</p>
    <p>Components of this project included; creating an html file, creating and implementing a seperate style file, understanding how to implement shadow boxes, and object rotation on the website.</p>

    <h3>Puppy WPF</h3>
    <p>My second favorite project was creating a WPF that read in the user's specified dog breed and returned to them the breed's information from a website.</p>
    <p>A class was made that set each breed's infomation equal to an object that could be used in comparsion to the users input.</p>
    <p>If a user's breed input was not recognizable, then they were sent a message box informing them of thier error.</p>

    <h3>Foodtruck Database</h3>
    <p>Currently, I am working on a project in my database class where my team is creating a database through SSMS to track a theoretical companies information.</p>
    <p>While we have not completed the assigment yet, so far it has taught me good time management, properly noting how tables relate to eachother, and the importance in using 3NF.</p>
